# Leetcode Rust

My personal daily Leetcode problems soluting in Rust.

Nothing special here, just a personal daily brain exercise only for fun.

The problems are organized by topics.

To test specific problems, use `cargo test test_<problem_number>`

for example, `cargo test test_1` will test the first problem.

each problem with also have a `Top Voted Solution` which impl as `SolutionTop`, along with test called `test_<problem_number>_top`.

for example, `cargo test test_1_top` will test the Top Voted solution by others.
