# Leetcode Rust

My personal daily Leetcode problems soluting in Rust.

Nothing special here, just a personal daily funny brain exercise.

The problems are organized by topics.

To test specific problems, use `cargo test test_<problem_number>`

for example, `cargo test test_1` will test the first problem.
